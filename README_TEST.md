Dependencies

* babel-preset-react - Is a plug-in for the babel compiler which makes it possible for the compiler to handle REACT modules. 

* babel-plugin-css-modules-transform - Is a plug-in for the babel compiler. This plug-in ignores the css files. THIS PLUG IN CAN'T BE USED WITH FRONTEND. Read more: https://github.com/michalkvasnicak/babel-plugin-css-modules-transform/blob/master/README.md
